		This page is intentionally empty. If you want to theme your profile page you
		could choose several ways to do it.
		
		1. Add blocks and use user/* as a path
		2. Use context module (recommended)
		3. Add code to this page. I recommend you to implement your own
		   hook_preprocess_profile_page() function to define variables
		   and use them here.
		   
		If you decide to use the third option, don't override this file, copy it
		to your theme and clear the cache
