moonrock-demo-old-nquire
========================

Modules of previous nQuire version, with changes and new modules to support the 
Moonrock demonstators.

Changes:

- Updated AHAH helper to 2.2.
- Fixed color picker: default colour is selected.
- Fixed moonrock_share_notes, it behaves now as pi_wiki_notes, having only one activity and one single node per user.
- Added moonrock_review_notes, which allows users to search and read notes (content of type moonrock_share_notes) created by other users.
